# Price-Prediction-of-Bitcoin-using-CNN-BiLSTM
This study's primary objective is to use a hybrid deep learning model to forecast the prices of cryptocurrencies. The objective of this study is to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price  predictions.


The research explores CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model the cryptocurrency dataset pre- Covid and 
Post Covid Time period. The dataset utilised for the research is the “Top 50 Cryptocurrencies 
Historical Prices” which was retrieved from Kaggle. The data is originally obtained from
Investing .com (an online data and news Financial information website).

In the analysis of the cryptocurrencies, it clearly displays that the open price, closing price, low price and high price tended to fluctuate erratically during covid and post Covid period (end of 2018 till 2021). It has been found that the CNN-BiLSTM model is highly accurate and efficient 
in predicting the prices of the three currencies as seen by the accuracy scores of above 93%, F1 
scores close to 1 and low RMSE scores for all three currencies.
